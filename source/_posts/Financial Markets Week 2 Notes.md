# Week 2 of the Financial Market Course
## Lesson 6
### Intuition of Efficiency
#### Course Notes
1. There was a pigeon Service for market information, before telegrah was invented.
2. The high speed of the information spreading closes the connection among markets in different areas.
3. Those prices in markets are the result of people trying to figure out values, and if we didn't have the markets, 
   we wouldn't know what anything was worth.
4. Not only are markets efficient in the current economy, they're better knowledge than any individual because it
   involves so many people of all putting their money on the line and trading them.
5. Common opinion in the 1980s (Richard Brealey and Stewart Myers): "Security prices accurately reflect the available 
   information, and respond rapidly to new information as soon as it becomes available, therefore, security prices
   reflect the true underlying value of assets."
6. However, they made adjustments relevant the above quotes after the 2008 Financial Crisis:
   “we have a full understanding of why asset prices sometimes get so out of line with what appears to be their
   discounted future payoffs.”
7. 3 forms of efficiency from Harry Robers (1967): weak (past price), semi-strong (all publicly available info), 
   strong (all info including private/internal info).    
   
#### Course Q&A
Q. Why does the efficient market hypothesis still a hypothesis after 50 years, and why someone advocates it got a Nobel 
Prize, and Prof. Shiller, who against it, also gets a Nobel Prize? 

A. It's a half-truth. The market, in many cases, is the top expert on a certain trading item. But, there are some
(maybe rare) occasions that the market is very wrong about one product/company.
